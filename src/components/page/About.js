          As one of the first private dental practices in Serbia, we offer a
          wide array of dental services, with main focus on improving the
          quality of life for our patients, primarily with oral surgery and
          implantology, but also with regeneration procedures of soft and hard
          tissues, parodontology and prosthodontics. To make our services as
          quick and painless as possible, our practice is equipped with
          up-to-date advanced technology, such as the soft tissue laser, CAD/CAM
          set up, apex locator, digital intraoral camera and many other. This is
          just one of the advantages that sets us apart from the competition. In
          our three decades of providing top quality with empathy dental
          services, we have successfully served thousands of satisfied clients,
          not only from Serbia but from all over the world. Dr Jelena
          Stojanovic, founder of our practice with over 35 years of experience,
          wanted to build a family oriented clinic to care for patients of all
          ages which he has successfully accomplished. His vision was shared and
          perfected by his son, Master of Science and a Specialist in Oral
          Surgery and Implantology, Dr Darko Darkovic who is successfully
          running the Clinic for the past 15 years. At the same time, Dr Darko
          is perfecting his expertise by continuous education in the country and
          abroad, all directed at giving the best possible treatment to our
          patients. Next to our clients from Serbia, more and more clients from
          all of the world are using our dental services. The increase of their
          numbers is easily explained with Belgrade being a popular tourist
          destination and when you combine that with top quality dental services
          that are given with empathy and care for our patients, you get a
          winning combination! Many satisfied clients can agree with this since
          many of them are coming to Belgrade even after the treatment. We are
          proud to state that our Clinic and staff are one of the only in this
          field that can offer a complete package of services to our clients,
          not only dental services but also all the services that one might need
          in all aspects of dental tourism such as: arrival organization,
          accommodation, activities in Belgrade and the region, translator
          services when required, etc. We invite everyone to enjoy all the
          qualities of our services and become a part of our family tradition!
          We are the only dental office in Serbia accredited by TEMOS
          International GmbH and awarded the Diplomatic Council certificate. We
          are also certified according to the requirements of ISO
          9001:2015.awarded.
